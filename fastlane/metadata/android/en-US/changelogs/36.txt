**Changelog:**
- Added update check via GitHub api
- Fixed drop down in Random screen not remembering what was selected
- Added Spin the bottle to Random shocks screen (Settings -> More tools -> Random shocks -> dice icon)
- Fixed live control logs always saying 30s
- Updated logic to use shockers with highest permissions even if multiple users/share links have the shocker. That way even if you add a share link with less permissions than another one you'll have the one with the highest permissions
