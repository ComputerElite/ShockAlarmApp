A powerful app for controlling [OpenShock](https://openshock.org/) shockers and setting alarms with custom tones.

A web version (for IOS, ...) can be found [here](https://computerelite.github.io/ShockAlarmApp/) (does not support live controls).

# Features
ShockAlarm is a powerful tool for controlling your Shockers via OpenShock. It allows you to fully manage your shockers, logs, shares, hubs, share links, tokens and sessions. On top it also allows you to seamlessly use ShareLinks.

There is advanced functionality like controlling multiple shockers at the same time, specifying a random interval for intensity, duration and a delay, live controls with patterns and alarms.

It's fully material you themed just like the standard Android apps you're already used to and provides a responsive ui with a nice design.

Furthermore it fixes some layout flaws of the official OpenShock Frontend like having shared and own shockers in separate tabs (which is annoying). On top it also has lots of info buttons you can press to get more insight on what something does.

You can also log in on multiple OpenShock instances at once. ShockAlarm will show all shockers from all instances seamlessly at a glance!

### Not supported in Web Version
Everything with websockets is currently not supported due to authentication problems with websockets. This includes:
- OTA Updates
- Enabling/Disabling the captive portal
- Live control

# Development
This app is based on flutter and thus you need to first install flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Afterwards clone the repository and get all dependencies:

1. `git clone https://github.com/ComputerElite/ShockAlarmApp`
2. `cd ShockAlarmApp`
3. `flutter pub get`

# Publishing
## Steps for making a new release
1. Test functionality of app on Android, Web and Linux.
2. (when adding new packages) Test the Android build pipeline by [manually triggering](https://github.com/ComputerElite/ShockAlarmApp/actions/workflows/build_android.yml)
3. Bump the version in [pubspec.yaml](pubspec.yaml) and [main.dart](main.dart)
4. Create a changelog at [fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs](fastlane/metadata/android/en-US) in a file names `<versioncode>.txt`. It should be markdown formatted.
5. Create a new tag (or release) and push it to the repo. Actions will spin up to compile the binaries and add the previously created changelog to the release
6. (optional) Update the screenshots in [fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/](fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/) for FDroid and the ReadMe

## Publishing on FDroid
FDroid will publish the update autonomously once a build cycle starts. The changelog we created earlier will be added to the FDroid page automatically
